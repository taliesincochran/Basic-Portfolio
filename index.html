				<p class='profiletext'>I grew up in rural Stanley County, N.C. on a horse farm. I learned to work hard and to never own a horse. I escaped to the North Carolina School of Math and Science for high school and N.C. State University for college, graduating with a B.S. in Biochemistry.  After that I worked at N.C. State in Dominique Robertson's viral genomics laboratory and then at Catalent Pharma Solutions in stability testing for pharmaceuticals.  I then became a father and stay at home dad, which was the greatest blessing of my life. Being a curious person interested in a variety of subjects, I decided it was time to learn something new, so I enrolled in the Coding Boot Camp at U.N.C. Chapel Hill and I'm getting to learn all sorts of neat things to help me become a full stack developer. </p>
			<p class='profiletext'>I currently live in Carrboro, N.C. In my free time, I can be found hiking, cycling, playing with my seven-year-old son, or curled up in my bed reading.  I enjoy reading about history, anthropology, linguistics, evolutionary biology, epidemiology, and astronomy. I also enjoy reading old science fiction books and marveling at what they got right and what they never saw coming.</p>
